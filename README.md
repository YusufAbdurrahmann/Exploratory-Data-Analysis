<h1>ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Learning Notes (By Yusuf Abdurrahman)</h1>
<p><em>"Understanding data deeply is the first step toward building powerful models."</em></p>

<h2>ðŸ“˜ What I Learned in Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>In this project, I explored several fundamental techniques to analyze and understand data before modeling:</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. Univariate Analysis</h3>
<p>Univariate analysis examines each variable individually. It helps us understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread of a single variable using techniques like histograms, boxplots, and summary statistics.</p>
<strong>Why it matters:</strong>
<p>It helps detect skewness, outliers, and irregularities in data, and informs necessary preprocessing steps.</p>

<h3>2. Bivariate Analysis</h3>
<p>Bivariate analysis explores the relationship between two variables. Common techniques include scatter plots, correlation coefficients, and crosstabs.</p>
<strong>Why it matters:</strong>
<p>It reveals whether variables are related, positively or negatively correlated, which can guide feature selection and modeling strategies.</p>

<h3>3. Multivariate Analysis</h3>
<p>Multivariate analysis investigates interactions among three or more variables simultaneously. Techniques include pair plots, heatmaps, and dimensionality reduction methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).</p>
<strong>Why it matters:</strong>
<p>It uncovers complex patterns and dependencies that are not visible when examining variables individually or in pairs.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>EDA is essential to uncover hidden patterns, spot anomalies, and develop hypotheses for further analysis.</li>
  <li>A thorough EDA improves the quality and effectiveness of machine learning models by ensuring a deep understanding of the dataset.</li>
</ul>
